Webcam / Visualiser tools for teachers

Every now and then I find it's useful to be able to use a webcam / visualiser to display a live feed on screen whilst teaching. 

This project is designed to be a quick tool to allow a teacher to zoom in on part of a live video feed and annotate it with lines, rectangles or scribbles.
